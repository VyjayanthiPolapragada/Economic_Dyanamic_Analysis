# Economic_Dynamic_Analysis
This project aims to delve into the intricate relationships between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), government debt, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using a detailed empirical analysis.

By employing sophisticated statistical techniques such as stationarity testing, cointegration analysis, and time series modeling, the study will uncover the underlying dynamics and long-term trends among these key economic indicators. 
The analysis will also include inflation adjustments to provide more accurate insights. 
Through comprehensive data exploration, advanced modeling, and collaborative efforts, the project seeks to inform economic policy and decision-making by highlighting how FDI and government debt impact GDP growth.
